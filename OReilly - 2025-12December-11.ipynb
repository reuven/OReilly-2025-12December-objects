    "How do we solve problems? Many times, in the computer world, it's easiest to solve problems if we have data structures that are aligned with our thinking. By creating custom data structures, on top of the ones that Python provides, we can (a) write code more easily, (b) understand/maintain code more easily, and even (c) get better performance out of our code.\n",

    "By doing this, we make our code easier to write and maintain. \n",

    "A few points to think about and to recap:\n",
    "\n",
    "- By creating a new data structure, we gain the power of abstraction, of ignoring the lower-level thinking and concentrating on the higher-level thinking.\n",
    "- Methods (verbs) are defined on the class, which means they are tightly bound to one particular data type. Regular functions can be invoked with any argument, until/unless something goes wrong -- sometimes because you invoked it with the wrong kind of argument! But in the case of methods, when you invoke a method, the instance on which you ran it is automatically given to the `self` parameter as a value. Other arguments are also OK, but the main one is automatically sent.\n",
    "- We can define new data types, aka \"classes,\" which are also known as \"types.\" Each type defines a combination of data structure (on top of existing ones) and methods (sometimes new, sometimes copied from elsewhere). You can use `type` as as function to find out what kind of data structure something is. You can only use `class` when defining a new class in Python.\n",
    "- The most important method on a class is `__init__` (\"dunder init\"). This method is invoked by Python after a new object has been created. Its job is to add attributes to the new instance that we have created. `__init__` will always have `self` as its first parameter, which in its case will be not only the instance, but the *new* instance without any attributes at all. In `__init__`, we want to assign any/all attributes that might be used on the instance down the road. `__init__` doesn't need to return anything; its job is only to assign attributes.\n",
