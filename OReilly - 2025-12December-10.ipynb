    "Software is hard to write. It's even harder to maintain.\n",

    "Even in the 1970s, people felt overwhelmed. They wanted a system that would allow them to write software more easily, and (most importantly) to maintain it more easily.\n",

    "Alan Kay worked at Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center), and he came up with the idea of designing software in pieces -- sort of like a biological entity. A human body is made up of many, many cells. Each cell has a type. Each type of cell sends off different types of messages, and receives different types of messages. Kay thought that we might be able to write software emulating the human body:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of cells, he called the pieces \"objects.\"\n",
    "- Instead of types of cells, he called the classifications \"classes\" or \"types\"\n",
    "- He talked about sending/receiving messages, what we today call \"calling methods.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Kay did this in a programming language called Smalltalk. Smalltalk convinced a lot of people that writing code in this way was a good way to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects have been around for 50+ years! Most programming languages support them in some way or another, including Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's the advantage? It makes it easier to think in concrete terms about the program, the data structures, and the things that they do. Objects try to mimic the real world. Instead of thinking about strings, lists, tuples, dicts, etc., you think about people, companies, cars, lunch menus, etc."

    "In the Smalltalk language, they liked to say that \"everything is an object.\" Why did this matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Everything followed the same rules -- from the core of the langauge to the things that individual coders wrote\n",
    "- The syntax was very regular\n",
    "- It's easier to hook your code together with code written by other people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you know how Python works (including its objects), then the core of the language makes more sense, extension modules to the language make more sense, and you can also add your own extensions (or modify those written by other people) in order to make the language more appropriate for solving your problems."
