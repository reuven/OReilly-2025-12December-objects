    "Software is hard to write. It's even harder to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even in the 1970s, people felt overwhelmed. They wanted a system that would allow them to write software more easily, and (most importantly) to maintain it more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alan Kay worked at Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center), and he came up with the idea of designing software in pieces -- sort of like a biological entity. A human body is made up of many, many cells. Each cell has a type. Each type of cell sends off different types of messages, and receives different types of messages. Kay thought that we might be able to write software emulating the human body:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of cells, he called the pieces \"objects.\"\n",
    "- Instead of types of cells, he called the classifications \"classes\" or \"types\"\n",
    "- He talked about sending/receiving messages, what we today call \"calling methods.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Kay did this in a programming language called Smalltalk. Smalltalk convinced a lot of people that writing code in this way was a good way to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects have been around for 50+ years! Most programming languages support them in some way or another, including Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's the advantage? It makes it easier to think in concrete terms about the program, the data structures, and the things that they do. Objects try to mimic the real world. Instead of thinking about strings, lists, tuples, dicts, etc., you think about people, companies, cars, lunch menus, etc."

    "- Everything followed the same rules -- from the core of the langauge to the things that individual coders wrote\n",
    "- The syntax was very regular\n",
    "- It's easier to hook your code together with code written by other people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you know how Python works (including its objects), then the core of the language makes more sense, extension modules to the language make more sense, and you can also add your own extensions (or modify those written by other people) in order to make the language more appropriate for solving your problems."

    "\n",
    "- `class` or `type` -- These words are interchangeable in Python when we speak, but they have different roles when we're writing programs. These describe categories of values. In Python, the special words `class` and `type` have different meanings. When we talk about a value, we'll say that its `type` (or `class`) is something:\n",
    "    - the number `5` has a `type` of `int`\n",
    "    - the string `'abcd'` has as `type` of `str`\n",
    "    - We can also say that a type is used to create new values of that type. So `str` creates new string objects, i.e., values of type `str`. And `list` creates new list objects, i.e., values of type `list`.\n",
    "- If I want to create a new value of type `X`, I just run `X()`:\n",
    "    - To get a new string, I can say `str()` or even `str(5)`\n",
    "    - To get a new integer, I can say `int()` or even `int('10')`.\n",
    "    - To get a new list, I can say `list()` or even `list('abcd')`\n",
    "- `instance` -- this is another word for \"value,\" but it's always tied to a type. So the value `'abcd'` is an *instance* of `str`. Another way to say that is: The type of `'abcd'` is `str`. Everything in Python is an object, which means that everything is an instance of some type/class. If you want to find out the type of some value, you can just invoke the `type` function on that value, and get a response.\n",
    "- `object` -- this word means a *lot* of related things, sadly. It means a value -- so you can say \"that string object.\" It also means, then, an instance, as in, \"That object is an instance of `str`.\" As if that weren't confusing enough, `object` is also a class, the default class for every value in Python!
